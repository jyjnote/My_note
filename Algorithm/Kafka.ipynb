    "## Kafka <sub>https://github.com/CUKykkim/kafka-docker</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Features:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Throughput and Scalability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka can handle a high volume of messages and scale horizontally to accommodate increased load.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Durability and Fault Tolerance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka ensures that messages are durable even in the event of node failures through replication and fault tolerance mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-time Data Processing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka supports real-time data processing by allowing consumers to subscribe and process messages as soon as they are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed System:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka is designed as a distributed system, allowing it to run on a cluster of machines to manage and process large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Retention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka allows configurable retention of messages for a specified time, enabling consumers to replay messages or go back in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pub-Sub Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka follows a publish-subscribe messaging model where producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to topics to consume messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A category or feed name to which messages are published by producers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Producer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An entity that publishes messages to Kafka topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consumer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An entity that subscribes to Kafka topics and processes the published messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broker:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Kafka server instance that stores and manages the topics, serving producers and consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A division of a topic that allows Kafka to parallelize message processing and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Replication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of duplicating partitions across multiple brokers to ensure fault tolerance and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ZooKeeper:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A distributed coordination service used by Kafka for managing and synchronizing the Kafka brokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Offset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique identifier assigned to each message within a partition, used to track the progress of consumers.\n",
    "These concepts and features characterize Kafka as a powerful and versatile distributed streaming platform, capable of handling large-scale, real-time data processing and messaging needs."
