# Text Mining: An Introduction ðŸ“š

Welcome to my personal repository for learning about **Text Mining**! ðŸŒŸ In this space, I document my journey in understanding and exploring the exciting field of text mining.

## What is Text Mining? ðŸ¤”

**Text Mining**, also known as **Text Analytics** or **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, is the process of deriving meaningful insights and knowledge from text data. It involves several techniques, including:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements (tokens).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying named entities such as names, locations, and organizations in the text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.
- **Topic Modeling**: Uncovering abstract topics or themes within a collection of text documents.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.

## Purpose of this Repository ðŸ“–

This repository is a dedicated space where I organize, experiment, and share my understanding of text mining concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. I'll be documenting my projects, notes, and code related to text mining.

Feel free to explore and learn along with me! âœ¨
